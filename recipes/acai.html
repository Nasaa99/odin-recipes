    This Acai Bowl recipe by Chef Jessica Randhawa is a 
    quick, vibrant, and nutrient-packed breakfast or 
    snack that you can whip up in just minutes. Made 
    from frozen acai puree blended with bananas, berries, 
    milk or juice, and a touch of yogurt, this bowl 
    delivers a thick, creamy texture bursting with fruity 
    flavor. Topped with your choice of granola, fresh 
    fruit, seeds, or nuts, it's a customizable, energizing 
    treat loaded with fiber, antioxidants, and healthy

    classic while offering flexibility for vegan,
