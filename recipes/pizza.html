  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Homemade pepperoni pizza is a delicious, family-friendly dish that turns any ordinary night into a pizza party. This version features a golden, crispy crust, a generous layer of mozzarella, and a clever “Bonus Pepperoni” trick—half the pepperoni is chopped and layered under the cheese for extra flavor in every bite. Whether using store-bought or homemade dough, this recipe adapts easily to your kitchen setup, with baking options using a pizza stone or cast iron skillet.
  </p>
  <p>
    The pizza is cooked at a high temperature to achieve a perfectly crisp crust, and it's topped with your favorite thin-sliced pepperoni for that signature charred finish. As a fun twist, it's served with optional honey butter for dipping the crust—a kid-approved touch inspired by Colorado-style pizza. With just 25 minutes of total cook time, it'ss a quick, satisfying alternative to delivery that delivers on both taste and texture.

  <h3>For the Quick Pizza Sauce:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce (no salt)</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated onion</li>

  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Preheat the oven to 500°F:</strong>
    If using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven for at least 20 minutes
    so it gets nice and hot.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Make the sauce:</strong>
    Stir together all sauce ingredients if you're using the homemade version.
    The recipe makes enough for one large pizza.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Roll out the dough:</strong>
    Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 14-inch circle. If it's
    hard to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Add the toppings:</strong>
    Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or cast iron skillet. Spread the sauce,
    add chopped pepperoni under the cheese, then top with more cheese and
    remaining pepperoni. Season with black pepper.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cook the pizza:</strong>
    If using a stone, cook the pizza in the center of the stone for 6 minutes,
    rotate it, then bake another 6–8 minutes. For a skillet, heat it on the
    stove for 2 minutes, then bake in the oven for 10–12 minutes until the crust
    is golden brown.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Slice and serve:</strong>
    Let the pizza rest briefly, slice it, and optionally top with fresh oregano.
    Serve warm with a side salad if desired.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Make the honey butter (optional):</strong>
    Stir together softened butter and honey. Serve as a dip for the crust.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Store leftovers:</strong>
    Keep leftovers in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in a skillet with oil
    over medium heat and cover until the cheese melts and the crust crisps.
  </li>
</ol>
