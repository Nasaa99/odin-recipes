  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Homemade pepperoni pizza is a delicious, family-friendly dish that turns any ordinary night into a pizza party. This version features a golden, crispy crust, a generous layer of mozzarella, and a clever “Bonus Pepperoni” trick—half the pepperoni is chopped and layered under the cheese for extra flavor in every bite. Whether using store-bought or homemade dough, this recipe adapts easily to your kitchen setup, with baking options using a pizza stone or cast iron skillet.

    The pizza is cooked at a high temperature to achieve a perfectly crisp crust, and it's topped with your favorite thin-sliced pepperoni for that signature charred finish. As a fun twist, it's served with optional honey butter for dipping the crust—a kid-approved touch inspired by Colorado-style pizza. With just 25 minutes of total cook time, it'ss a quick, satisfying alternative to delivery that delivers on both taste and texture.
